# Repository structure
The code for this project is organised as follows.
- A knapsack class is implemented in `knapsack.py` in the `task6` folder. This class contains the greedy heuristic and 
  the guroby callback function for the branch and cut algorithm of task 6.
- In task1 and task6 there are `simulation.py` and `performance_analysis.py` files which simulate knapsack instances and 
  analyse results of solving these.
